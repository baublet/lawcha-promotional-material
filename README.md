# Attractive InDesign Templates for LAWCHA
inDesign Templates for Promotional Material for LAWCHA

# What is this?

In March and April of 2016, I was tasked with designing promotional material for the Labor and Working-Class History Association. Because the work I do for them is mostly original open source, I wanted to put them here. This helps especially for my future self or future LAWCHA officers, board members, or just people who want high quality promotional material for us.

# Use

Use all of these however you want as templates for anything and everything! The only exception is the LAWCHA name, which you must get permission to reuse in any form. For more information, see [LAWCHA.org](http://lawcha.org).
